For this challenge, we have to analyze a 35 megabyte =PCAP= file. Opening it up on
Wireshark, it's possible to see that it has over 95.000 entries, 42% of them are
related to the =SMB= / =SMB2= protocols. There are a bunch of sequential
authentication attempts with a lot of different usernames. This challenge's flag
requires a username and a password, therefore, there has to be a user here that
did go through the authentication process.

After all the requests, there is always a response with the error
=STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE=. This error comes from the =NT Status= value, in this case,
=0xc000006d=. Looking at the [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-erref/596a1078-e883-4972-9bbc-49e60bebca55][documentation]], the success code is =0x00000000=. Using
the Wireshark filter ~smb2.nt_status == 0x00000000~, we can see all the responses
that didn't error out. This query will return 9110 entries, it's still a lot.
Every entry is similar and is related to the protocol negotiation, except one:

And this entry also has the account and domain: =hackbackzip= and =DESKTOP-0TNOE4V=
respectively. Taking into account the nature of =NTLMv2=, there won't be any kind
of passwords in plain text here. So the next step is to actually build the
necessary string for it to serve as the input into a password cracker. It has
the following format:

#+BEGIN_SRC
username::domain:challenge:NTProofStr:blob
#+END_SRC

We already got the username and the domain. The challenge is in a previous
request that has an error like =NTLMSSP_CHALLENGE=:

[[file:writeup-img/2025-05-11_00-43-27_screenshot.png]]

And the =NTProofStr= and the =blob= are in the =NTLMSSP_AUTH= request of the user
=hackbackzip=:

This is the resulting string, that should be put in an empty text file in a
single line:

#+BEGIN_SRC
hackbackzip::DESKTOP-0TNOE4V:d102444d56e078f4:eb1b0afc1eef819c1dccd514c9623201:01010000000000006f233d3d9f9edb01755959535466696d0000000002001e004400450053004b0054004f0050002d00300054004e004f0045003400560001001e004400450053004b0054004f0050002d00300054004e004f0045003400560004001e004400450053004b0054004f0050002d00300054004e004f0045003400560003001e004400450053004b0054004f0050002d00300054004e004f00450034005600070008006f233d3d9f9edb010900280063006900660073002f004400450053004b0054004f0050002d00300054004e004f004500340056000000000000000000
#+END_SRC

Now it's only a matter of using a password cracker with a decent word list. I
recommend the =rockyou.txt= word list:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
john --format=netntlmv2 account.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
#+END_SRC
