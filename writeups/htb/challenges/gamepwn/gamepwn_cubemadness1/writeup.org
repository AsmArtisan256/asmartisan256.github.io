This game, like most, is an =EXE= file I have to run under Wine or Proton. Looks
like a simple game, where you have to collect the well known HTB cubes. You have
to collect 20 of them, but jumping around, I could only get 6 of them.

How can we get all of them? Going around the "jail" the ball is in, there are no
more cubes to collect, so it's time to call the classic tool for game hacking:
=Cheat Engine=. Being under GNU/Linux and Proton is not issue since I use
=protontricks-launch= to launch an executable file in the same environment the
game is running in. If that does not work (i.e. you can't read the addresses),
you have to use a very manual command to run =Cheat Engine=:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH=~/.steam/ STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/<APP_ID>/ WINEPREFIX=~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/<APP_ID>/pfx <PATH_TO_PROTON>/proton run cheatengine-x86_64.exe

So, after attaching =Cheat Engine= to the game, we start using the classic
technique everybody familiar with the tool knows. We start searching the memory
for the value =0=. We get so many addresses so we have to narrow it down! We catch
a cube and search for the value =1= and we still get too many addresses. I only
got it right after getting the 4th cube and searching for the value =4=.

Since I only got 3 addresses with the value =4=, which seems to match the points
in the game, we copy those addresses to the Cheat Engine address list, freeze
them and set their value to =20= and the flag appears instantly in the game.
